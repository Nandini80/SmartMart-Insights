# Need
1 Efficient Decision-Making: Walmart operates on a massive scale, and manual or traditional methods of analyzing trends, understanding customer behavior, or forecasting sales are not sufficient. This project offers automated, data-driven solutions for timely and informed decisions.

2 Sales Forecasting: Anticipating future sales is essential for optimizing inventory, aligning staffing, and preparing for peak shopping seasons or holidays. Accurate forecasting minimizes stockouts and overstock situations, directly impacting revenue.

3 Competitive Advantage: In a highly competitive retail market, gaining deeper insights into store performance, regional trends, and customer preferences enables Walmart to stay ahead of competitors.

4 Dynamic Insights from Web Scraping: Static data is often outdated. By scraping updated store and sales information from Walmart’s website, this project ensures real-time insights that are crucial for strategic planning.

5 Resource Optimization: By integrating mathematical optimization techniques, Walmart can better allocate resources like staff, inventory, and marketing budgets to maximize efficiency.

6 Customer-Centric Strategies: Analyzing trends helps identify what customers need and when they need it, enabling Walmart to personalize offerings, improve customer satisfaction, and boost loyalty.
